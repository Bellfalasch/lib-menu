# View help

For your convenience we've added a few example views for rendering a fully semantic menu in HTML5 that you can use on your website. Choose one of the html files included depending on how many levels you need. Then just add your own styling via CSS.

Some classes are added to the wrapping `<li>` element to assist your stylesheets. They are easy to change, but here's what they are used for:
`has-children` - Used to indicate that there are sub menu items present (for displaying drop down icon or similar).
`path` - Added if this is a parent menu item to the currently viewed page/content on your website.
`active` - This is the currently viewed page/content on the website. It will not have "path" class.

## Installation:

* *First: Add one of the mixins!*
* Just select one of the HTML-files in this folder and copy all the code
* Go to your app's source code and add this code anywhere you want (in a part or page)
* Make sure your controller uses `libs.menu.getMenuTree(x)` and sends this into the view as a parameter called `menuItems`, see general installation guide in the root README.md file for more info.

Now you are done. Edit some content in your Enonic XP Admin interface and choose to display them in the menu. Vo√≠la!

## Example controller code

Normal use:

```javascript
	// Get my menu
	var menuItems = libs.menu.getMenuTree(2);
	var params = {
		menuItems = menuItems
	};

	// Rendering time
	var view = resolve("myhtmlfile.html");
	var body = libs.thymeleaf.render(view, params);
	return { body: body };
```

When extracting submenus you wont be using `getMenuTree` but use `getSubMenus` instead (no need to change your Thymeleaf), here's an example:

```javascript
	var content = libs.portal.getContent(); // Get current content
	var menuItems = libs.menu.getSubMenus(content,2); // Get submenu
	var params = {
		menuItems = menuItems
	};

		// Rendering time
	var view = resolve("myhtmlfile.html");
	var body = libs.thymeleaf.render(view, params);
	return { body: body };
```
