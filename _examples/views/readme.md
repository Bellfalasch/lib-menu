For your convenience we've added a few example mixins that you can use on your website.

Installation:

* *First: Add one of the mixins!*
* Just select a file and copy the HTML-code in it
* Go to your apps source code and add this code anywhere you want it
* Make sure your controller uses `libs.menu.getMenuTree(x)` and sends this into the view as a parameter called `menuItems`

Now you are done. Edit some contents in your Enonic XP Admin interface and choose to display them in the menu. Vo√≠la!
